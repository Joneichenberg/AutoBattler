# AutoBattler
We created an auotbattler game based on characters from genshin impact.
There is a powerpoint that goes over how to play the game called Genshin Autobattler.pptx.
This was one of my favorite group projects personally.
Utilized the MVC architecture for code design, java language, and java fx library for graphics.

In src autobattler.java is how to launch the application granted you have javafx,
AutoBattlerController.java is the controller between the model and the view
AutoBattlerModel.java is the model 
AutoBattlerGUIView.java is the view and uses javafx for graphics
